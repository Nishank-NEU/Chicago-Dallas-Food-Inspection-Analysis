# Chicago-Dallas-Food-Inspection-Analysis
Overview : 
This project delves into analyzing food inspection data from two major cities, Chicago and Dallas. The primary objective is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to food safety standards and inspection outcomes across these cities. The project leverages ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques, beginning with the creation of a dimensional model using ER Studio, followed by data preparation, cleaning, and visualization using Alteryx, Power BI, and Tableau.

Datasets : 
The project utilizes two distinct datasets: Chicago Food Inspection Data and Dallas Food Inspection Data. These datasets contain comprehensive information about food inspections conducted in Chicago and Dallas, including inspection dates, establishment details, violation codes, inspection results, and more.

Process : 
Dimensional Model Creation: The project commenced with the creation of a dimensional model using ER Studio. This model facilitated the organization and structuring of data for efficient analysis and querying. Subsequently, the model was converted into SQL scripts to establish a new database.

Data Preparation and Profiling with Alteryx: Following the creation of the dimensional model, the datasets underwent data preparation and profiling using Alteryx. This stage aimed to understand data distribution, identify patterns, and assess data quality across both datasets.

Data Cleaning, Transforming, and Staging: Post data profiling, the datasets were subjected to cleaning, transforming, and staging processes. This involved addressing missing values, standardizing formats, and preparing the data for analysis. The cleaned and transformed data was then staged for loading into the database.

Database Storage: The cleaned and transformed data from both datasets were stored in the newly created database. This ensured organized and accessible data for further analysis and querying, facilitating combined analysis from Chicago and Dallas datasets.

Visualization with Power BI and Tableau: The final step involved visualizing insights derived from the combined datasets using both Power BI and Tableau. Various visualizations such as charts, graphs, and dashboards were crafted to showcase key trends and patterns in food inspection outcomes across Chicago and Dallas.
